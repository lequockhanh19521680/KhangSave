<P>The repair parts now in supply are limited to those connectors having common
shapes and terminal cavity numbers. Therefore, when there is no available
replacement connector of the same shape or terminal cavity number, please
use one of the alternative methods described below. Make sure that the
terminals are placed in the original order in the connector cavities, if
possible, to aid in future diagnosis.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>When a connector with a <U>different number of terminals</U> than the original part is used, select a connector having more terminal
cavities than required, and replace both the male and female connector
parts.<BR>EXAMPLE: You need a connector with six terminals, but the only replacement available is a connector with eight terminal cavities. Replace both the male and female connector parts with the eight terminal part, transferring the terminals from the old connectors to the new connectors.
  <P></P>
  <LI>When several <U>different type terminals</U> are used in one connector, select an appropriate male and female connector
part for each terminal type used, and replace both male and female connector
parts.<BR>EXAMPLE: You need to replace a connector that has two different types of terminals in one connector. Replace the original connector with two new connectors, one connector for one type of terminal, another connector for the other type of terminal.
  <P></P>
  <LI>When a <U>different shape of connector</U> is used, first select from available parts a connector with the appropriate
number of terminal cavities, and one that uses terminals of the same size
as, or larger than, the terminal size in the vehicle. The wire lead on
the replacement terminal must <U>also</U> be the same size as, or larger than, the nominal size of the wire in the
vehicle. (&quot;Nominal&quot; size may be found by looking at the illustrations
in the section F or by direct measurement across the diameter of the insulation).
Replace all existing terminals with the new terminals, then insert the
terminals into the new connector.<BR>EXAMPLE: You need to replace a connector that is round and has six terminal cavities. The only round replacement connector has three terminal cavities. You would select a replacement connector that has six or more terminal cavities and is not round, then select terminals that will fit the new connector. Replace the existing terminals, then insert them into the new connector and join the connector together.
