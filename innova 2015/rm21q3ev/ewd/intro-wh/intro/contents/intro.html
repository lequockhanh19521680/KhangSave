<BLOCKQUOTE>The wire harness (W/H) is systems of electric wires for automobiles to
connect all the electronics parts in automobile electrically and work them.
As more electronics parts are introduced in automobiles recently, the electric
wires used for the wire harness are increasing in number and the structure
is becoming more complicated. As a result of that, there are hundreds of
connectors, which is the parts which connects wires mechanically and electrically,
in one vehicle. Therefore, numbers of the connector terminal (Terminal)
or the connector housing (Housing) are designed to meet many kinds of uses
of circuits. Various components have been improved to ensure the product
reliability or realize a wider space in the vehicles.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Wire harness mainly consists of wires, terminals, or housings.<BR>
There are various components are designed for many parts of vehicles, such as one with high heat-resistance, water-resistance, or bending ability, ones have different current capacities, or ones are hardly influenced by electromagnetic noise.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The electric wires used for the wire harness consists of the conductor made from numbers of twisted mild copper or aluminum wire with a diameter of less than 0.5 mm and the insulator surrounding the conductor.<BR>
The insulator is generally made from vinyl chloride and covers the conductor with even thickness. The insulators are color-coded in order to distinguish each wire. The base colors or the stripe patterns are used to make difference between insulators. Each color of wires is indicated by the abbreviation in the repair manual and the electrical wiring diagram.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Terminal connects wires and housing insulates connecting parts.<BR>
There are the male terminal and the female terminal. The types of terminals
are decided by tab width of male terminal. And the terminal with the rubber
plug or the rubber ring is used in the part, such as the engine compartment,
which become wet. For the circuit with slight current at EFI system or
ABS system, the gold-plated terminal is introduced for ensuring reliabilities.<BR>
As the number of the circuit is increasing recently, there are new types
of parts introduced. For example, there is the hybrid type housing, which is a combination of terminals with different tab width, such as the
power source terminal or the signal terminal. Also, new type of connector
such as the double lock housing, which is designed with the retainer in
addition to the lance to prevent terminal from slipping off, is available.
The new type of connectors are produced to realize higher product reliabilities
and utilized widely recently. The major characteristics of these new connectors
are shown in the table 1.<BR>
There are two types of lances: housing lance, which is inside the housing
and terminal lance, which is inside the terminal.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A CFW (Compression Forming Wire-harness) is a wire harness protector made
of non woven fabric and formed by hot compression molding. One of the two
types of CFWs offers desired routings where wire harnesses should go through,
and the other insulates noises that are likely to occur when wire harnesses
and the vehicle body interfere with each other.<br>
<br>
If the wire harness is protected with CFWs, refer to the cautions listed
below for handling.<br>
<ul>
  <li> Do not deform or fold.
  <li>Store at normal temperature and humidity.
  <li>Protect from dirt or metal flakes. (Do not place or store in dusty locations)
  <li>Protect from water. (Do not store in humid locations. Also, store in indoor locations to protect from rain)
  <li>Protect from fluids and oil/grease.<br>Liquids: Battery fluids, washer fluids, LLC etc.<br>Oil/grease: Lubricants, silicon oil, engine oil, brake fluids etc.
  <li>Do not cut CFWs to repair wire harnesses.
