<ptxt>FOR VEHICLES WITH SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM</ptxt>
<ptxt>The TOYOTA INNOVA is equipped with a Supplemental Restraint System (SRS). The SRS of this vehicle consists of the following:</ptxt>
<list1 type="ordered">
<item>
<ptxt>Steering pad</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Front seat outer belt assembly</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Center airbag sensor assembly</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Front airbag sensor assembly</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<atten2>
<list1 type="unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>Failure to carry out service procedures in the correct sequence could cause SRS parts to unexpectedly deploy and possibly lead to serious injuries. Furthermore, if a mistake is made when servicing SRS parts, they may fail to operate when required. Before performing servicing (including installation/removal, inspection and replacement of parts), be sure to read the following precautions.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Before starting work, wait at least 90 seconds after the ignition switch is turned OFF and after the cable of the negative (-) battery terminal is disconnected. (SRS parts are equipped with a backup power source. If work is started within 90 seconds of turning the ignition switch OFF and disconnecting the cable from the negative (-) battery terminal, SRS parts may deploy.)</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Do not expose SRS parts directly to hot air or flames.</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
</atten2>
<atten3>
<list1 type="unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>Malfunction symptoms of SRS parts are difficult to confirm. DTCs are the most important source of information when troubleshooting. During troubleshooting, always confirm DTCs before disconnecting the cable from the negative (-) battery terminal.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>For minor collisions where SRS parts do not deploy, always inspect the SRS parts.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Before performing repairs, remove airbag sensors as necessary if any kind of impact is likely to occur to an airbag sensor during repairs.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Never use SRS parts from another vehicle. When replacing SRS parts, replace them with new ones.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Never disassemble or attempt to repair SRS parts.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>If an SRS part has been dropped, or if there are any cracks, dents or other defects in the case, bracket or connector, replace the SRS part with a new one.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Use an ohmmeter/voltmeter with high impedance (10 kΩ/V minimum) for troubleshooting the electrical circuits.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Information labels are attached to the periphery of SRS parts. Follow the cautions and instructions on the labels.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>After work on SRS parts is completed, perform the SRS warning light check.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>When the cable is disconnected from the negative (-) battery terminal, the memory settings of each system will be cleared. Because of this, be sure to write down the settings of each system before starting work. When work is finished, reset the settings of each system as before. Never use a backup power supply from outside the vehicle to avoid erasing the memory in a system.</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
</atten3>
<step2>
<ptxt>SPIRAL CABLE</ptxt>
<step3>
<ptxt>The steering wheel must be fitted correctly to the steering column with the spiral cable at the neutral position, as cable disconnection and other problems may occur. Refer to the information about correct installation of the steering wheel.</ptxt>
</step3>
</step2>
<step2>
<ptxt>AIRBAG ASSEMBLY</ptxt>
<step3>
<ptxt>Airbag assembly with pad:</ptxt>
<ptxt>Always place a removed or new airbag assembly with the pad surface facing upward. Placing the airbag assembly with the airbag inflation direction facing downward could cause a serious accident if the airbag inflates. Also, do not place anything on top of the airbag assembly.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Never measure the resistance of the airbag squib. This may cause the airbag to inflate, which could cause a serious injury.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Grease or detergents of any kind should not be applied to the airbag assembly.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Store the airbag assembly in an area where the ambient temperature is below 93°C (200°F), the humidity is not high and there is no electrical noise.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>When using electric welding anywhere on the vehicle, disconnect the airbag ECU connectors. These connectors contain shorting springs. This feature reduces the possibility of the airbag deploying due to currents entering the squib wiring.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>When disposing of the vehicle or the airbag assembly by itself, the airbag should be deployed using SST before disposal. Activate the airbag in a safe place away from electrical noise.</ptxt>
</step3>
</step2>
<step2>
<ptxt>SEAT OUTER BELT ASSEMBLY WITH PRETENSIONER</ptxt>
<step3>
<ptxt>Never measure the resistance of the seat outer belt. This may cause the pretensioner of the seat outer belt to activate, which could cause serious injury.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Never install the seat outer belt on another vehicle.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Store the seat outer belt in an area where the ambient temperature is below 80°C (176°F), the humidity is not high and there is no electrical noise.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>When using electric welding anywhere on the vehicle, disconnect the airbag ECU connectors (2 pins). These connectors contain shorting springs. This feature reduces the possibility of the pretensioner deploying due to currents entering the squib wiring.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>When disposing of a vehicle or the seat outer belt by itself, the pretensioner should be activated before disposal. Activate the pretensioner in a safe place away from electrical noise.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>As the seat outer belt is hot after the pretensioner is activated, allow some time for it to cool down sufficiently before disposal. Never apply water to try to cool down the seat outer belt.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Grease, detergents, oil or water should not be applied to the seat outer belt.</ptxt>
</step3>
</step2>
<step2>
<ptxt>AIRBAG SENSOR ASSEMBLY</ptxt>
<step3>
<ptxt>Never reuse an airbag sensor assembly that has been involved in a collision where the SRS has deployed.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>The connectors to the airbag sensor assembly should be connected or disconnected with the sensor placed on the floor. If the connectors are connected or disconnected while the airbag sensor assembly is not placed on the floor, the SRS may activate.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Work must be started at least 90 seconds after the ignition switch is turned OFF and the cable is disconnected from the negative (-) battery terminal, even if only loosening the set bolts of the airbag sensor assembly.</ptxt>
</step3>
</step2>
<step2>
<ptxt>WIRE HARNESS AND CONNECTOR</ptxt>
<step3>
<ptxt>The SRS wire harness is integrated with the instrument panel wire harness assembly. All the connectors in the system are yellow. If the SRS wire harness becomes disconnected or the connector becomes broken, repair or replace it.</ptxt>
