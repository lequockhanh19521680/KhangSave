<ptxt>The vehicle is equipped with a Supplemental Restraint System (SRS), which consists of a steering pad, instrument panel passenger airbag assembly, front seat outer belt, center airbag sensor and front airbag sensor. Failure to carry out service procedures in the correct sequence could cause SRS parts to unexpectedly deploy and possibly lead to serious injuries. Furthermore, if a mistake is made when servicing SRS parts, they may fail to operate when required. Before performing servicing (including installation/removal, inspection and replacement of parts), be sure to read the following precautions.</ptxt>

<item>
<ptxt>Before starting work, wait at least 90 seconds after the ignition switch is turned off and after the cable of the negative (-) battery terminal is disconnected. (SRS parts are equipped with a backup power source. If work is started within 90 seconds of turning the ignition switch off and disconnecting the cable from the negative (-) battery terminal, SRS parts may deploy.)</ptxt>

<ptxt>HANDLING PRECAUTIONS FOR AIRBAG SENSOR</ptxt>
<atten4>
<ptxt>In this section, the center airbag sensor, front airbag sensor LH, and front airbag sensor RH are collectively referred to as the airbag sensors.</ptxt>
</atten4>
<step2>
<ptxt>Before replacement of the airbag sensor, wait at least 90 seconds after disconnecting the cable from the negative (-) battery terminal.</ptxt>
</step2>
<step2>
<ptxt>When connecting or disconnecting an airbag sensor connector, ensure that all of the sensors are installed in the vehicle.</ptxt>

<ptxt>INSPECTION PROCEDURE FOR VEHICLE INVOLVED IN ACCIDENT</ptxt>
<step2>
<ptxt>When the airbag has not deployed, confirm the DTC by checking the SRS warning light. If there is any malfunction in the SRS, perform troubleshooting.</ptxt>
</step2>
<step2>
<ptxt>When any of the airbags have deployed, replace the related airbag sensor and inspect its normal operation.</ptxt>

<ptxt>DEPLOYMENT CONDITION</ptxt>
<step2>
<ptxt>When the vehicle is in a collision and the shock is greater than the specified value, the SRS is activated automatically. The safing sensor and deceleration sensor are built into the center airbag sensor. The safing sensor is designed to be turned on at a smaller deceleration rate than the deceleration sensor. The deceleration sensor determines whether or not SRS deployment is necessary based on signals from the front airbag sensor. Current flows to the squibs to deploy the SRS when the conditions shown in the illustration below are met.</ptxt>
