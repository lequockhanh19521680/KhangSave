<ptxt>PROBLEM SYMPTOM CONFIRMATION</ptxt>
<step2>
<ptxt>Based on the result of the customer problem analysis, try to reproduce the symptoms. If the problem is that the transmission does not shift up or shift down, or the shift point is too high or too low, conduct the following road test referring to the automatic shift schedule and simulate the problem symptoms.</ptxt>
</step2>
</step1>
<step1>
<ptxt>ROAD TEST</ptxt>
<atten3>
<ptxt>Perform the test at the normal operating ATF temperature of 50 to 80°C (122 to 176°F).</ptxt>
</atten3>
<step2>
<ptxt>D position test</ptxt>
<ptxt>Move the shift lever to D and fully depress the accelerator pedal. Check the following:</ptxt>
<step3>
<ptxt>Check up-shift operation.</ptxt>
<ptxt>Check that the 1 → 2, 2 → 3 and 3 → 4 up-shifts take place at the shift points shown in the automatic shift schedule (see page <xref label="Seep01" href="RM000001OQI00TX"/>).</ptxt>
<atten4>
<ptxt>4th Gear Up-shift Prohibition Control</ptxt>
<list1 type="unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>Engine coolant temperature is less than 55°C (131°F) and vehicle speed is less than 80 km/h (50 mph).</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<ptxt>4th Gear Lock-up Prohibition Control</ptxt>
<list1 type="unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>Brake pedal is depressed.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Accelerator pedal is released.</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
</atten4>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Check for shift shock and slip.</ptxt>
<ptxt>Check for shock and slip at the 1 → 2, 2 → 3 and 3 → 4 up-shifts.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Check for abnormal noise and vibration.</ptxt>
<ptxt>Drive the vehicle in D lock-up or 4th gear and check for abnormal noises and vibrations.</ptxt>
<atten3>
<ptxt>If abnormal noises and/or vibrations occur, conduct a thorough check of the cause. Failure to repair the problem may lead to subsequent problems in the differential, torque converter, etc.</ptxt>
</atten3>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Check kick-down operation.</ptxt>
<ptxt>While driving the vehicle in 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear with the shift lever on D, check that the possible kick-down vehicle speed limits for the 2 → 1, 3 → 2 and 4 → 3 kick-downs conform to those indicated on the automatic shift schedule (see page <xref label="Seep02" href="RM000001OQI00TX"/>).</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Check for abnormal shock and slip at kick-down.</ptxt>
</step3>
<step3>
<ptxt>Check the lock-up mechanism.</ptxt>
<ptxt>Drive the vehicle in 4th gear with the shift lever on D. Maintain a steady speed (lock-up on) of about 80 km/h (50 mph). Lightly depress the accelerator pedal and check that the engine speed does not change abruptly.</ptxt>
<atten4>
<ptxt>If there is a sudden increase in engine speed, there is no lock-up.</ptxt>
</atten4>
</step3>
</step2>
<step2>
<ptxt>3 position test</ptxt>
<ptxt>Move the shift lever to 3 and fully depress the accelerator pedal. Check the following:</ptxt>
<step3>
<ptxt>Check up-shift operation.</ptxt>
<ptxt>Check that the 1 → 2 and 2 → 3 up-shifts take place at the shift points shown in the automatic shift schedule (see page <xref label="Seep04" href="RM000001OQI00TX"/>).</ptxt>
<atten4>
<ptxt>There is no 3 → 4 up-shift or 4th gear lock-up in the 3 position.</ptxt>
</atten4>

<step2>
<ptxt>2 position test</ptxt>
<ptxt>Move the shift lever to 2 and fully depress the accelerator pedal. Check the following:</ptxt>
<step3>
<ptxt>Check up-shift operation.</ptxt>
<ptxt>Check that the 1 → 2 up-shift takes place and that the shift point conforms to the automatic shift schedule (see page <xref label="Seep03" href="RM000001OQI00TX"/>).</ptxt>
