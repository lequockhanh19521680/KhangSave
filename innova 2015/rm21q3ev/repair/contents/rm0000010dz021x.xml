<ptxt>Install a new or non-depleted battery (lithium battery).</ptxt>
<atten4>
<ptxt>When a new or non-depleted battery is not available, first connect 2 new 1.5 V batteries in series. Then connect leads to the batteries and use the leads to apply 3 V to the transmitter, as shown in the illustration.</ptxt>

<ptxt>When checking the amount of energy left in the battery (lithium battery: CR2016), the battery must be checked while it is installed in the transmitter (a resistance of 1.2 kΩ is applied to the battery). When the battery energy is checked by itself (uninstalled), the voltage reading will be more than 2.5 V until the energy is depleted.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>If the transmitter is malfunctioning, the voltage reading of the energy left in the battery will be inaccurate.</ptxt>

<ptxt>Connect a wire to the negative (-) terminal of the transmitter and install the battery.</ptxt>
</s3>
<s3>
<ptxt>Connect the tester's positive (+) lead to the battery (lithium battery: CR2016) and the negative (-) lead to the wire.</ptxt>
</s3>
<s3>
<ptxt>Press one of the transmission switches on the transmitter for approximately 1 second.</ptxt>
</s3>
<s3>
<ptxt>Press the transmission switch on the transmitter again to check the voltage.</ptxt>

<ptxt>When the temperature of the battery is low, the inspection result will not be accurate. When the inspection result is less than 2.2 V, conduct the test again after leaving the battery in a place with a temperature of 18°C (64°F) for more than 30 minutes. </ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Read the voltage immediately after the switch is pressed. When 0.8 seconds have passed after the switch is pressed, the automatic power off function starts and resistance applied to the battery will cease. The voltage of the battery will be 2.5 V or more.</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>Press the switch at least 3 times before reading the voltage. If the battery temperature has just returned to 18°C (64°F), the voltage may be unusually high for the first or second voltage reading.</ptxt>
