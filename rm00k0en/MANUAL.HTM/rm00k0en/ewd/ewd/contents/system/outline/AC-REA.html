<p><b>Blower Motor Operation</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>*Low speed operation</p>
<p>When the blower SW (Rear) is moved to LO position, current flows to TERMINAL 4 of the blower SW (Rear) to GROUND, activating the rear cooler relay. This causes the current to flow from the RR CLR fuse to TERMINAL 1 of the rear cooler relay to TERMINAL 2 to TERMINAL 2 of the blower motor (Rear) to TERMINAL 1 to TERMINAL 1 of the blower resistor (Rear) to TERMINAL 4 to GROUND, causing the blower motor (Rear) to rotate at low speed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*Medium speed operation (Operation at M1, M2)</p>
<p>When the blower SW (Rear) is moved to M1 position, current flows to TERMINAL 4 of the blower SW (Rear) to GROUND, turning the rear cooler relay to switch on. This causes the current to flow from the RR CLR fuse to TERMINAL 1 of the rear cooler relay to TERMINAL 2 to TERMINAL 2 of the blower motor (Rear) to TERMINAL 1 to TERMINAL 1 of the blower resistor (Rear) to TERMINAL 2 to TERMINAL 3 of the blower SW (Rear) to GROUND. At this time, the blower resistance of the blower resistor (Rear) is less than at low speed, so the blower motor (Rear) rotates at medium low speed.<br>When the blower SW (Rear) is moved to M2 position, current flows through the motor flows from TERMINAL 1 of the blower resistor (Rear) to TERMINAL 3 to TERMINAL 2 of the blower SW (Rear) to GROUND. At this time, resistance of the blower resistor (Rear) is less than at M1 position, so the blower motor (Rear) rotates at medium high speed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*High speed operation</p>
<p>When the blower SW (Rear) is moved to HI position, current flows to TERMINAL 4 of the blower SW (Rear) to GROUND, turning the rear cooler relay to switch on.<br>This causes the current to flow from the RR CLR fuse to TERMINAL 1 of the rear cooler relay to TERMINAL 2 to TERMINAL 2 of the blower motor (Rear) to TERMINAL 1 to TERMINAL 1 of the blower SW (Rear) to GROUND, causing the blower motor (Rear) to rotate at high speed.</p>
