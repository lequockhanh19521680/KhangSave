<h3>System Outline</h3>
<hr>
<p></p>
<p>With the ignition SW turned on, the current flows to TERMINAL (B) 2 of the front wiper and washer SW, TERMINAL 1 of the windshield washer motor and TERMINAL 2 of the windshield wiper motor through the WIP fuse.</p>
<p><b>1.Low Speed Position</b></p>
<p>With the front wiper SW turned to LO position, the current flows from TERMINAL (B) 2 of the front wiper and washer SW to TERMINAL (B) 3 to TERMINAL 1 of the windshield wiper motor to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND and causes the windshield wiper motor to run at low speed.</p>
<p><b>2.High Speed Position</b></p>
<p>With the front wiper SW turned to HI position, the current flows from TERMINAL (B) 2 of the front wiper and washer SW to TERMINAL (B) 4 to TERMINAL 4 of the windshield wiper motor to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND and causes the windshield wiper motor to run at high speed.</p>
<p><b>3.INT Position</b></p>
<p>With the front wiper SW turned to INT position, the wiper relay operates and current flows from TERMINAL (B) 2 of the front wiper and washer SW to TERMINAL (A) 2 to GROUND. This activates the intermittent circuit and the current flows from TERMINAL (B) 2 of the front wiper and washer SW to TERMINAL (B) 3 to TERMINAL 1 of the windshield wiper motor to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND and the wiper operates.<br>The intermittent operation is controlled by the charge/discharge function of the condenser installed in the relay, and the intermittent time is controlled by a time control SW to change the charging time of the condenser (w/ INT time SW).<br>Intermittent operation is controlled by a condenser charge and discharge function in the relay (w/o INT time SW).</p>
<p><b>4.Mist Position</b></p>
<p>With the front wiper SW turned to MIST position, the current flows from TERMINAL (B) 2 of the front wiper and washer SW to TERMINAL (B) 3 to TERMINAL 1 of the windshield wiper motor to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND and causes the windshield wiper motor to run at low speed.</p>
<p><b>5.Washer Interlocking Operation</b></p>
<p>With the washer SW pulled to ON position, the current flows from the WIP fuse to TERMINAL 1 of the windshield washer motor to TERMINAL 2 to TERMINAL (A) 3 of the front wiper and washer SW to TERMINAL (A) 2 to GROUND and causes the windshield washer motor to run and the window washer to spray. Simultaneously, current flows from the WIP fuse to TERMINAL (B) 2 of the front wiper and washer SW to TERMINAL (B) 3 to TERMINAL 1 of the windshield wiper motor to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND, causing the wiper to function.</p>
