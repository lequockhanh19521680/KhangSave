<p><b>1.Manual Down or Up Operation</b></p>
<p>When the power window master SW is pushed one step, the motor rotates to open the window.<br>When the power window master SW is pulled up one step, the motor rotates in the opposite direction, to close the window.<br>All the other windows can be opened/closed as well, by the operation of the power window master SW or respective power window SW.<br>When the window lock SW is pushed to the lock side, the ground circuit to the passenger’s window becomes open. As a result, even if Open/Close operation of the passenger’s window is attempted, the current from TERMINAL E of the power window master SW is not grounded and the motor does not rotate, so the passenger’s window can not be operated and window lock occurs.</p>
<p><b>2.Auto Down Operation (Driver’s Window)</b></p>
<p>When the power window master SW is pushed two steps, the motor rotates to open the window automatically.</p>
<p><b>3.Stopping of Auto Down or Up Operation (Driver’s Window)</b></p>
<p>Auto operation can be stopped in mid­course with switching power window master SW one step downward during the up operation and upward during the down operation.</p>
