<h3>System Outline</h3>
<hr>
<p></p>
<p><b>1.Manual Lock Operation</b></p>
<p>When the door lock control SW or driver’s side door key lock and unlock SW (When driver’s seat belt is unfastened) are operated to LOCK position, a lock signal is input to TERMINAL 14 of the integration relay and causes the integration relay to function. The current flows from TERMINAL 5 of the integration relay to TERMINAL 3 to the door lock motors to TERMINAL 2 of the integration relay to TERMINAL 1 to GROUND and the door lock motors locks the door.</p>
<p><b>2.Manual Unlock Operation</b></p>
<p>When the door lock control SW or driver’s side door key lock and unlock SW (When driver’s seat belt is unfastened) are operated to UNLOCK position, an unlock signal is input to TERMINAL 11 of the integration relay and causes the integration relay to function. The current flows from TERMINAL 5 of the integration relay to TERMINAL 2 to the door lock motors to TERMINAL 3 of the integration relay to TERMINAL 1 to GROUND and the door lock motors unlocks the door.</p>
<p><b>3.Speed­Sensitive Automatic Door Lock Function</b></p>
<p>Under the precondition that one of the doors is opened with the ignition SW OFF, the theft warning ECU outputs lock signal to the integration relay and the relay sends the lock signal to all the door lock motors when all the following conditions are satisfied.</p>
<p>*All the door are shut.</p>
<p>*The unlock warning SW is ON besides the ignition SW is ON.</p>
<p>*The vehicle speed reaches about 25km/h.</p>
<p><b>4.Ignition SW Linked Automatic Door Unlock Function</b></p>
<p>Under the precondition that the unlock warning SW is ON as well as the ignition SW is ON after door locked by the speed­sensitive automatic door lock, the theft warning ECU outputs unlock signal to the integration relay and the relay sends the unlock signal to all the door lock motors when all the following conditions are satisfied</p>
<p>*The unlock warning SW is ON.</p>
<p>*The ignition SW is OFF.</p>
