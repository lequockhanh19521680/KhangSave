<p>Current is applied at all times through the FR HTR fuse to TERMINAL 5 of the HTR relay.<br>When the ignition SW is turned on, the current flows through the ECUÂ­IG&amp;GAUGE fuse to TERMINAL 1 of the HTR relay to TERMINAL 2 to TERMINAL 6 of the blower SW.</p>
<p><b>Blower Motor Operation</b></p>
<p>*Low speed operation</p>
<p>When the blower SW is moved to LO position, the current flows to TERMINAL 6 of the blower SW to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND, causing the HTR relay to turn on. This causes the current flows from the FR HTR fuse to TERMINAL 5 of the HTR relay to TERMINAL 3 to TERMINAL 2 of the blower motor to TERMINAL 1 to TERMINAL 1 of the blower resistor to TERMINAL 4 to GROUND, rotating the blower motor at low speed.<br></p>
<p>*Medium speed operation (Operation at M1, M2)</p>
<p>When the blower SW is moved to M1 position, the current flows to TERMINAL 6 of the blower SW to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND, causing the HTR relay to turn on. This causes the current flows from the FR HTR fuse to TERMINAL 5 of the HTR relay to TERMINAL 3 to TERMINAL 2 of the blower motor to TERMINAL 1 to TERMINAL 1 of the blower resistor to TERMINAL 2 to TERMINAL 2 of the blower SW to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND. At this time, the blower resistance of the blower resistor is smaller than at low speed, so the blower motor rotates at medium low speed.<br>When the blower SW is moved to M2 position, the current flows through the HTR relay to TERMINAL 2 of the blower motor to TERMINAL 1 to TERMINAL 1 of the blower resistor to TERMINAL 3 to TERMINAL 1 of the blower SW to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND. At this time, resistance of the blower resistor is smaller than at M1 position, so the blower motor rotates at medium high speed.<br></p>
<p>*High speed operation</p>
<p>When the blower SW is moved to HI position, the current flows to TERMINAL 6 of the blower SW to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND, causing the HTR relay to turn on.<br>This causes the current flows from the FR HTR fuse to TERMINAL 5 of the HTR relay to TERMINAL 3 to TERMINAL 2 of the blower motor to TERMINAL 1 to TERMINAL 4 of the blower SW to TERMINAL 5 to GROUND, rotating the blower motor at high speed.</p>
